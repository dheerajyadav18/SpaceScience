        <h1>Why Colonization?</h1><br>
        <ul>
            <li>We have put men on the Moon. <b>Can people live in space?</b> Can permanent communities be built
                and inhabited off the Earth? Not long ago these questions would have been dismissed as
                science fiction, as fantasy or, at best as the wishful thinking of men ahead of their
                times Now they are asked seriously not only out of human curiosity, but also because
                circumstances of the times stimulate the thought that space colonization offers large
                potential benefits and hopes to an increasingly enclosed and circumscribed humanity.
            </li>

            <li><b>Permanent communities can be built and inhabited off the Earth. </b> following chapters
                present a detailed description of a system for the colonization of space. It is not the
                best system that can be devised; nor is it complete. Not all the important questions about
                how and why to colonize space have been posed. Of those that have, not all have been
                answered satisfactorily. Nevertheless, the 10-week summer study is the most thorough
                and comprehensive one made to date. On its basis space colonization appears to be
                technically feasible, while the obstacles to further expansion of human frontiers in
                this way are principally philosophical, political, and social rather than technological.</li>

            <li><b>The idea of terraforming Mars – aka "Earth's Twin" – is a fascinating idea.</b> Between melting the
                polar ice caps, slowly creating an atmosphere, and then engineering the environment to have
                foliage, rivers, and standing bodies of water, there's enough there to inspire just about anyone!
                But just how long would such an endeavor take, what would it cost us, and is it really an
                effective use of our time and energy?</li>



            <li>Such were the questions dealt with by two papers presented at NASA's <b>"Planetary Science Vision
                    2050 Workshop"</b> last week (Mon. Feb. 27th – Wed. Mar. 1st). The first, titled "The Terraforming
                Timeline", presents an abstract plan for turning the Red Planet into something green and habitable.
                The second, titled <b>"Mars Terraforming – the Wrong Way"</b>, rejects the idea of terraforming
                altogether
                and presents an alternative.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"Terraforming Mars can be divided into two phases.</b> The first phase is warming the planet from the
                present average surface temperature of <b>-60° C </b> a value close to Earth's average temperature to
                <b>+15° C</b>,
                and recreating a thick <b>CO²</b> atmosphere. This warming phase is relatively easy and quick, and could
                take
                <b>~100 years</b>. The second phase is producing levels of <b>O²</b> in the atmosphere that would allow
                humans and other
                large mammals to breath normally. This oxygenation phase is relatively difficult and would take 100,000
                years or more, unless one postulates a technological breakthrough."
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The suggestion that humans will soon set up bustling, long-lasting
                    colonies on Mars is something many of us take for granted.</b> What this
                lofty vision fails to appreciate, however, are the monumental—if not
                intractable—challenges awaiting colonists who want to permanently
                SPACE Humans Will Never Colonize Mars live on Mars. Unless we radically
                adapt our brains and bodies to the harsh Martian environment, the Red Planet
                will forever remain off limits to humans.

            <h2>About Mars</h2><br>
            <li>
                Mars, <b>fourth planet in the solar system</b> in order of distance from the Sun and seventh in size and
                mass.
                It is a periodically conspicuous reddish object in the night sky. Mars is designated by the symbol ♂.
                <b>Sometimes called the Red Planet,</b> Mars has long been associated with warfare and slaughter. It is
                named
                for the Roman god of war. <b>As long as 3,000 years ago</b>,Babylonian astronomer-astrologers called the
                planet Nergal for their god of death and pestilence. The planet’s two moons, Phobos (Greek: “Fear”)
                and Deimos (“Terror”), were named for two of the sons of Ares and Aphrodite (the counterparts of Mars
                and Venus, respectively, in Greek mythology).
            </li>
            <h2>Why Colonize Mars? </h2>
            <li>My grades aren't too bad in history, and I could bore you with a story
                about 16th century Europeans and dreams of leaving their crowded,
                disease-infested cities and moving to the New World. I could ramble
                on about how the expansion to this continent brought about
                progresses in exploration and cartography that would fuel the scientific
                revolution of a new age. And I could explain how the country that
                came out of it advanced the world perhaps centuries beyond its time in
                scientific, economic, diplomatic, and religious progress. But that's not
                why you're here. </li>
            <li><b>1. Its Similarity to Earth</b><br>
                Mars has water, frozen underground and at the
                polar caps. There is evidence that this water has, in
                the past and present, flooded the surface in liquid
                form. Signs of erosion can be found on the slopes of
                craters and volcanoes. Geological features
                resembling those on Earth suggest that Mars was
                once a wet and hospitable planet.

                <br>A day on Mars is 24.5 hours long. Mars is a third the size of Earth, but
                it has as much land area as the seven continents combined. Its gravity
                is 2.7 times less than that of Earth: enough to remain flat-footed on
                the surface, but a low enough escape velocity to make launching from
                Mars relatively simple. Remember, it was much easier for Apollo to lift
                off from the moon than it was to leave Earth. Construction materials
                would be lighter as well, facilitating labor in the early colony. The
                health benefits of such an environment are unknown, but it is
                theorized that Mars might prevent and relieve forms of arthritis and
                back pain. Also, Martian-born children might be taller than their Terran
                cousins.
            </li>
            <li><b>2. Its Scientific Secrets</b><br>
                With its similarity to Earth, there is a strong possibility that bacterial
                life (or something more?) exists on the planet. Some people believe
                that Viking detected it way back in 1976. Others believe that we found
                it in a Martian meteorite. Rovers are on their way to Mars to settle the
                debate, but we may only be sure if humans look for themselves. As
                any engineer will tell you, the ease with which a human being can
                cover a stretch of ground and examine specimens along the way,
                gathering and processing data, cannot be emulated with a machine. If
                we ever find life, we can begin to answer some of the biggest
                questions we've ever asked: "Are we alone in the universe? What else
                is out there? What is the basic unit of life? What does life need to
                survive?"<br>
                From a geological standpoint alone, Mars is exciting because it offers
                scientists a view of how planets develop. Mars is billions of years older
                than the Earth, and its features are much more exaggerated. The
                largest canyons, volcanoes, and craters in the solar system are
                available for our study. </li>
            <li><b>3. Its Diplomatic Potential</b><br>
                It is obvious that the world isn't perfect, but we've been trying for the
                entirety of our civilized existence. We've reached a point now where
                the majority of the world's superpowers are on good enough terms to
                begin an international joint-project to colonize Mars. This was much
                the theory with the International Space Station, but dirty politics
                proved how immature the world's superpowers are. Ending the
                quarrelling and going to space might sound like ignorant idealism, but
                imagine the diplomatic potential. When we become united in a goal,
                not just as Americans or as Russians but as mankind, all of humanity
                puts aside its differences.<br>
                Even if the initial trip to Mars is sponsored by one nation or one space
                agency, in the end Mars will be for everyone. The Old World's
                boundaries will not be able to restrain the emigration. Who knows, the
                concept of countries might remain a thing of the Earth, an archaic
                reminder of castles and kings and the battle for power. Mars could be
                the beginning of a new era in human diplomacy.</li>
            <li><b>4. Its Economic Value</b><br>
                Mars is worth a lot of money. There are 144 trillion square meters of
                surface area, roughly the land area of the Earth, available for
                development. I'm not going to tell you how great all that land is for
                residential, commercial, and industrial use... go play Sim City.<br>
                An important part of the fusion reaction process is deuterium, a stable
                isotope of hydrogen. Once we can contain a fusion reaction, the
                deuterium-tritium reaction has a high yield of energy for the small
                amount of fuel put in. Deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, is hard to obtain
                on Earth, but on Mars it is five times more abundant in the form of
                Hydrogen-Deuterium-Oxygen (See Also: Compositions). A milliliter of
                liquid heavy-hydrogen fuel would produce as much energy as 20 tons
                of coal. Deuterium is also important in chemistry because it reacts the
                same way as hydrogen, but can be distinguished from hydrogen by its
                mass. These reactions occur slower than normal hydrogen reactions.<br>
                There is an abundance of rare metals on Mars such as platinum, gold,
                silver, and others. Shipping from Mars to Earth, as mentioned above,
                is much easier than the other way around. Even more promising is the
                proximity of the asteroid belt to Mars. Dactyl, the moon orbiting the
                asteroid Ida shown in this picture, is 1.4 kilometers in diameter, yet it
                contains more iron that the human race has used in its entire
                existence. These asteroids could be mined near Mars and shipped from
                the planet for little cost. What we could see develop is a triangle trade
                route, much like the one in the 18th century between Britain, the West
                Indies, and America. The economic potential is colossal.</li>
            <li><b>5. Its Location</b><br>
                That brings us to our next point: location. Mars is relatively close to
                the Earth. Mars sits between the asteroid belt and us, acting as a kind
                of stepping stone to what lies beyond. It remains close enough to the
                sun to benefit from its heat (and light) but remains far enough away to
                be protected from any significant change in the sun's heat output. (We
                still know little about the sun's long-term heat cycles.)</li>
            <li><b>6. Its Home for Mankind</b><br>
                My personal favorite reason for colonizing Mars is that it offers a
                backup plan for humanity. Every few million years, the Earth tends to
                be wiped clear of almost all life in a globally catastrophic event (read:
                asteroid collision). An asteroid the size of Dactyl could wipe us off the
                face of the Earth. Who knows how close we've already come to
                blowing ourselves to smithereens. <br>
                A colony on Mars is not far off, but the question remains: could that
                colony be self-sufficient? The time will come when Mars will not need
                Earth to sustain it, much like the United States found itself long before
                the Revolutionary War. Does that mean life will be self-sufficient? No.
                We may be able to grow our own food on the planet in greenhouses,
                but what about wild animals, and birds, and fish, and rivers, and
                oceans? Terraforming, then, becomes a necessity in more than one
                way. Terraforming is the process of creating another Earth, and you
                can find out more about it by reading the various terraforming articles
                on this site. The general consensus is terraforming is necessary for
                global colonization and global colonization is necessary for
                terraforming. The two go hand-in-hand.</li>
            <li><b>7. Its Challenge for Mankind</b><br>
                Colonizing Mars will no doubt be the most
                difficult thing that humanity has ever pursued.
                Like building a bridge or a skyscraper, it will
                represent the pinnacle of human achievement
                up to that time. We can begin colonization now
                with technology that exists now; this is not
                science fiction anymore.<br>
                Before he began his fateful expedition to Mount Everest, George
                Mallory was asked why man kept trying to reach the summit of that
                mountain. "Because it is there," he said.<br>
                In the words of the great science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson,
                "We are the consciousness of the universe, and our job is to spread
                that around, to go look at things, to live everywhere we can. It's too
                dangerous to keep the consciousness of the universe on one planet; it
                could be wiped out. Mars will always remain Mars, different from
                Earth, colder and wilder. But it can be Mars and ours at the same time.
                And it will be. There is this about the human mind: if it can be done, it
                will be done. We can do it, so we will do it. So we might as well start."</li>

                    <li>It starts with Instagram posts and discarded parachutes, and the sense that a world is ours for
                        the taking.</li>
                    <li>Sometime in April, the Ingenuity helicopter will take to the Martian air, making it, in NASA’s
                        words, “the
                        first attempt at powered, controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet.” Or, to put it in
                        more mundane
                        terms, Mars will have become another airport. Of course, many crafts have already landed on
                        Mars—the most recent
                        carrying the rover Perseverance, with the Ingenuity copter nested inside.
                        <br>

                        That landing spot was named by the NASA team “Octavia E. Butler Landing.” (Official site
                        christenings throughout
                        the solar system must be bestowed by the International Astronomical Union.) At first blush, this
                        seems like a
                        deserved homage to Butler as a visionary artist (for her contributions to the genre of
                        speculative fiction) and
                        as a pathbreaking figure (as the first sci-fi author to receive a MacArthur Fellowship). The
                        name conjoins the
                        daring mission of the Perseverance rover with the legacy of a luminous writer of intellectually
                        daring novels.
                        It also meaningfully honors a Black woman, on behalf of NASA.
