    <h2>Facts about Space</h2><br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1) One million Earths could fit inside the sun – and the sun is considered an average-size star.
      </li>
      <li>
        2) For years it was believed that Earth was the only planet in our solar system with liquid water. More
        recently, NASA revealed its strongest evidence yet that there is intermittent running water on Mars, too!
      </li>
      <li>
        3) Comets are leftovers from the creation of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago – they consist of
        sand, ice and carbon dioxide.
      </li>
      <li>
        4) You wouldn’t be able to walk on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune because they have no solid surface!
      </li>
      <li>
        5) If you could fly a plane to Pluto, the trip would take more than 800 years!
      </li>
      <li>
        6) Space junk is any human-made object orbiting Earth that no longer serves a useful purpose. Scientists
        estimate there are about 500,000 pieces of space junk today, including fragments from rockets and satellites,
        and everyday items like spanners dropped during construction of the International Space Station!
      </li>
      <li>
        7) An asteroid about the size of a car enters Earth’s atmosphere roughly once a year – but it burns up before it
        reaches us. Phew!
      </li>
      <li>
        8) The highest mountain known to man is on an asteroid called Vesta. Measuring a whopping 22km in height, it is
        three times as tall as Mount Everest!
      </li>
      <li>9) There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s at least a
        billion trillion!

      </li>
      <li>
        10) The sunset on Mars appears blue.
      </li>
    </ul>
      <p>The solar system is a bizarre place with its alien planets, mysterious moons and strange phenomena that are so
        out-of-this-world they elude explanation. Scientists have discovered ice-spewing volcanoes on Pluto, while Mars
        is home to a truly "grand" canyon the size of the United States. There may even be a giant, undiscovered planet
        lurking somewhere beyond Neptune. Read on to find out some of the strangest facts about planets, dwarf planets,
        comets and other incredible objects around the solar system.</p>
        </div>
      <br>
      <div class="uranus">
      <h2>
        1. Uranus is tilted on its side
      </h2>
      <p>Uranus appears to be a featureless blue ball upon first glance, but this gas giant of the outer solar system is
        pretty weird upon closer inspection. First, the planet rotates on its side for reasons scientists haven't quite
        figured out. The most likely explanation is that it underwent some sort of one or more titanic collisions in the
        ancient past. In any case, the tilt makes Uranus unique among the solar system planets.</p>
      <h2>2. Jupiter's moon Io has towering volcanic eruptions</h2>
      <p>
        For those of us used to Earth's relatively inactive moon, Io's chaotic landscape may come as a huge surprise.
        The Jovian moon has hundreds of volcanoes and is considered the most active moon in the solar system, sending
        plumes up to 250 miles into its atmosphere . Some spacecraft have caught the moon erupting; the Pluto-bound New
        Horizons craft caught a glimpse of Io bursting when it passed by in 2007.
      </p>
      <h2>
        3. Mars has the biggest volcano (that we know of)
      </h2>
      <p>
        While Mars seems quiet now, we know that in the past something caused gigantic volcanoes to form and erupt. This
        includes Olympus Mons, the biggest volcano ever discovered in the solar system. At 374 miles (602 km) across,
        the volcano is comparable to the size of Arizona. It's 16 miles (25 kilometers) high, or triple the height of
        Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Mars also has the longest valley</h2>
      <p>
        If you thought the Grand Canyon was big, that's nothing compared to Valles Marineris. At 2,500 miles (4,000 km)
        long, this immense system of Martian canyons is more than 10 times as long as the Grand Canyon on Earth. Valles
        Marineris escaped the notice of early Mars spacecraft (which flew over other parts of the planet) and was
        finally spotted by the global mapping mission Mariner 9 in 1971.


      </p>
      <h2>
        5. Venus has super-powerful winds
      </h2>
      <p>
        Venus is a hellish planet with a high-temperature, high-pressure environment on its surface. Ten of the Soviet
        Union's heavily shielded Venera spacecraft lasted only a few minutes on its surface when they landed there in
        the 1970s.
        But even above its surface, the planet has a bizarre environment. Scientists have found that its upper winds
        flow 50 times faster than the planet's rotation. The European Venus Express spacecraft (which orbited the planet
        between 2006 and 2014) tracked the winds over long periods and detected periodic variations. It also found that
        the hurricane-force winds appeared to be getting stronger over time.

      </p>
      <h2>
        6. There is water ice everywhere
      </h2>
      <p>
        NASA/JHUAPL/Carnegie Institution of Washington/DLR/Smithsonian InstitutionWater ice was once considered a rare
        substance in space, but now we know we just weren't looking for it in the right places. In fact, water ice
        exists all over the solar system. Ice is a common component of comets and asteroids, for example. But we know
        that not all ice is the same. Close-up examination of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko by the European Space
        Agency's Rosetta spacecraft, for example, revealed a different kind of water ice than what is found on Earth.
        That said, we've spotted water ice all over the solar system. It's in permanently shadowed craters on Mercury
        and the moon, although we don't know if there's enough to support colonies in those places. Mars also has ice at
        its poles, in frost and likely below the surface dust. Even smaller bodies in the solar system have ice –
        Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres, among others.

      </p>
      <h2>
        7. Spacecraft have visited every planet
      </h2>
      <p>
        We've been exploring space for more than 60 years, and have been lucky enough to get close-up pictures of dozens
        of celestial objects. Most notably, we've sent spacecraft to all of the planets in our solar system — Mercury,
        Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — as well as two dwarf planets, Pluto and Ceres.
        The bulk of the flybys came from NASA's twin Voyager spacecraft, which left Earth in 1977 and are still
        transmitting data from beyond the solar system in interstellar space. Between them, the Voyagers clocked visits
        to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, thanks to an opportune alignment of the outer planets.

      </p>
      <h2>
        8. There could be life in the solar system, somewhere
      </h2>
      <p>
        So far, scientists have found no evidence that life exists elsewhere in the solar system. But as we learn more
        about how "extreme" microbes live in underwater volcanic vents or in frozen environments, more possibilities
        open up for where they could live on other planets. These aren't the aliens people once feared lived on Mars,
        but microbial life in the solar system is a possibility.
        Microbial life is now considered so likely on Mars that scientists take special precautions to sterilize
        spacecraft before sending them over there. That's not the only place, though. With several icy moons scattered
        around the solar system, it's possible there are microbes somewhere in the oceans of Jupiter's Europa, or
        perhaps underneath the ice at Saturn's Enceladus, among other locations.

      </p>
      <h2>
        9. Mercury is still shrinking
      </h2>
      <p>
        For many years, scientists believed that Earth was the only tectonically active planet in the solar system. That
        changed after the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft did the
        first orbital mission at Mercury, mapping the entire planet in high definition and getting a look at the
        features on its surface.
        In 2016, data from MESSENGER (which had crashed into Mercury as planned in April 2015) revealed cliff-like
        landforms known as fault scarps. Because the fault scarps are relatively small, scientists are sure that they
        weren't created that long ago and that the planet is still contracting 4.5 billion years after the solar system
        was formed.

      </p>
      <h2>
        10. There are mountains on Pluto
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pluto is a tiny world at the edge of the solar system, so at first it was thought that the dwarf planet would
        have a fairly uniform environment. That changed when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by there in 2015,
        sending back pictures that altered our view of Pluto forever. [Destination Pluto: NASA's New Horizons Mission in
        Pictures]
        Among the astounding discoveries were icy mountains that are 11,000 feet (3,300 meters) high, indicating that
        Pluto must have been geologically active as little as 100 million years ago. But geological activity requires
        energy, and the source of that energy inside Pluto is a mystery. The sun is too far away from Pluto to generate
        enough heat for geological activity, and there are no large planets nearby that could have caused such
        disruption with gravity.

      <h1>
        1. Footprints on the moon will stay for millions of years
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        It’s been over 50 years since Neil Armstrong stepped with his left foot onto the surface of the moon, and his
        footprints are still there. There’s no weather, wind, or water to disturb them, so they could remain there
        undisturbed for millions of years.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>
        2. Some planets have no surface to land on
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are four gas giants in our solar system — Jupiter, Saturn, Uran, Neptune — where it wouldn’t be possible
        to land on. Although different in composition, a gas giant is usually made out of hydrogen and helium and has a
        small rocky center.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>
        3. Saturn would float in water
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Hypothetically, that’s true. Saturn’s less dense than water which means that if put in a very large bowl of
        water, it would float. However, as Saturn is a gaseous planet, placing it in water would probably just dissolve
        the gases and its small rocky center would sink to the bottom of the bowl.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>
        4. Jupiter has at least 79 moons
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Not only the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter also has the most moons in its orbit. So far,
        scientists have discovered 79 moons, including the biggest one in the solar system — Ganymede with a diameter of
        5,268 km (3,273.4 mi).
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>
        5. There are interstellar objects passing through our solar system
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        The first interstellar object (ISO) was detected in 2017 and called ʻOumuamua (it gets its name from the
        Hawaiian word “scout”). It is a small red object (no longer than 1,000 meters and wider than 167 meters) that
        formed in a different star system. It travels about 500 million miles per year and will re-enter interstellar
        space in the late 2030s.

  <h3>Factors Determining the launch</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
       1. Generally satellites and missiles launch from east coast
        When seen from the North Pole, the Earth rotates anti-clock wise. It means in general term, from west to east as
        we see the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. </li>
      <li> 2. The surface velocity of rotation varies from point to point on the Earth. It is about 1600 km per hour or
        about 460 meters in a second near the equator.</li>


      <li>3.The velocity gradually reduces as we move to the poles and it is practically zero there. A satellite launched
        from the sites near the equator towards the east direction will get an initial boost equal to the velocity of
        Earth surface. This is similar to an athlete circling round and round before throwing a discus or a shot put.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The initial boost helps in cutting down the cost of rockets used to launch the satellites. </li>
      <li> 5. This is the major reason for launching satellites in the east ward direction. But this benefit can be taken
        only for such satellites which are placed in geo-stationary orbit or which circle the Earth parallel to the
        equator. Such satellites are usually communication satellites or satellites used for scientific research such as
        ISS.</li>
      <li>6. There are other satellites which are placed in polar orbits moving across the equator in north south direction
        and used mainly for mapping or some times for spying. Such satellites are generally launched in south ward or
        north ward direction and therefore cannot take advantage of the Earth’s rotation.
      </li>
      <li> 7. Despite the costs and risks associated with building, launching and operating satellites, some companies have
        managed to grow their space technology business. Boeing is one of those companies. Its Defense, Space and
        Security division managed to deliver 10 satellites in 2012 and acquire orders for seven more, contributing to
        the business unit's nearly $32 billion in revenue [source: The Boeing Company.
      </li>
      <li> 8. A Satellite is a Projectile. The fundamental principle to be understood concerning satellites is that a
        satellite is a projectile. That is to say, a satellite is an object upon which the only force is gravity. Once
        launched into orbit, the only force governing the motion of a satellite is the force of gravity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p><br><br>
  <h3>Scheduling changes in Lauches</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> 1. Thunderstorms can be one of the most dangerous types of weather for rocket launches, especially in Florida
        where thunderstorms pop up nearly every day in the summer.</li>
      <li>2. Rockets sitting on the launch pad are safe from lightning due to lightning rods around the pad, but after lift
        off, they are susceptible to being struck.</li>
      <li>3. NASA has eight different launch weather criteria that relate to thunderstorms to ensure that an Atlas V rocket
        is safe from lightning throughout its entire launching process.</li>
      <li>4. This includes making sure that there are no thunderstorms within a 10 nautical-mile radius of the launch pad
        and that there have not been any lightning strikes within a 10 nautical-mile radius of the launch pad in the 30
        minutes prior to scheduled launch time.</li>
      <li>5. A lightning strike almost spelled the end to the Apollo 12 mission before it even left the Earth's atmosphere.
      </li>
      <li>6. Even if it is not raining, a thick layer of clouds could be all it takes for an Atlas V launch to be
        postponed.</li>
      <li>7. Flying through a thin layer of clouds is generally harmless to the rocket, but if the cloud layer is greater
        than 4,500-feet-thick and extends into freezing temperatures, it can create issues that endanger the rocket's
        safety.</li>
      <li>8. In March, a Falcon 9 launch by SpaceX was scrubbed due to high wind shear. CEO Elon Musk said that the high
        shear "hits like a sledgehammer when [the rocket is] going up supersonic."As I mentioned above, someone on the
        tech team needs to be able to explain the project details regularly to the “non-tech” executives and other
        involved parties. It’s vital for someone on the team to have strong visualization and storytelling skills in
        order to communicate clearly and regularly what’s happening with the project.</li>
      <li>9. Lack of user testing, or failure to address feedback.</li>
      <li>10. Money plays a big role in every field it can effect the project or ut can boost the project.</li>
      <li>11. According to NASA, WFIRST was supposed to do the following: study dark energy, measure the history of cosmic
        acceleration, complete the exoplanet census and demonstrate technology for direct imaging and characterization
        of exoplanets.</li>
      <li>12. Astronomers said they are saddened by this cut because now the astronomers have to rely on outside research
        instead of conducting it in the United tates. Megan Donahue, American Astronomical Society president-elect, even
        said the overall change in the astrophysics budget could cripple U.S. astronomy.
        But even he holds some mistaken ideas about the agency. Right now, we depend on the Russians for access to the
        International Space Station, and given Russia’s current volatility (to say the least), Culberson asked Bolden
        what contingency plans NASA has if Russia decides to pull out.</li>
